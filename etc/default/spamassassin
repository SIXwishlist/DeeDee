# See man spamd for possible options. The -d option is automatically added.

# unless you know what you're doing.

# Pid file
# Where should spamd write its PID to file? If you use the -u or
# --username option above, this needs to be writable by that user.
# Otherwise, the init script will not be able to shut spamd down.
